# API-Football MCP Server

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that wraps the [API-Football v3](https://www.api-football.com/) REST API, exposing football/soccer data as MCP tools. Built with Python and [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp).

## Features

- 40+ MCP tools covering teams, players, fixtures, standings, transfers, odds, and more
- Streamable HTTP, SSE, and stdio transports
- Async HTTP client with rate-limit tracking and error handling
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- An API-Football API key (get one at [api-football.com](https://www.api-football.com/))

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/API-Football.git
   cd API-Football
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your API key:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and add your API-Football key:
   ```
   API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Server

```bash
# Default: streamable-http on port 8111
python server.py

# Stdio transport (for direct MCP client piping)
python server.py --transport stdio

# SSE transport on a custom port
python server.py --transport sse --port 9000

# Custom host and port
python server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

The MCP endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:8111/mcp`.

### Docker

```bash
# Using docker compose
docker compose up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t api-football-mcp .
docker run -d -p 8111:8111 --env-file .env --name api-football-mcp api-football-mcp

# Or use the deploy script (builds, runs, and health-checks)
./deploy.sh
```

## MCP Client Configuration

To connect this server to an MCP client, add it to your MCP config:

**Streamable HTTP (remote/Docker):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-football": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8111/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Stdio (local):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-football": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["server.py", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/API-Football",
      "env": {
        "API_FOOTBALL_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
